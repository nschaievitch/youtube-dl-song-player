# youtube-dl-song-player
A test project for listening to music from youtube dl and youtube music. It is not to be used with purposes other than educational.

## Description
This repo has a React Frontend which works as a music player, allowing the user to search for any song and play it. It also has support for queues and works with the MediaSession API. It then interacts with either the Node or Golang API (they are both compatible) which fetches data from YouTube Music, downloads the song from YouTube and sends it to the user.

Use the corresponding shell scripts to run, names should be intuitive.
